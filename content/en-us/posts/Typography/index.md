{{< tab-panel name="English" checked=true >}}
Once upon a time, there was a powerful and great president in American history. He ordered some young soldiers to find the country's treasure.

This treasure had been a legend for many years and had been sought by many people. However, it had never been found.

The young soldiers searched mountains, rivers, caves, and many difficult tests, but they found nothing and were very disappointed.

The president thanked them for their efforts and said to them, "Even after all these years, we still haven't found anything. You should be proud of the great effort you've made. So, everyone, please go back."

Listening to the president's words, the young soldiers calmed down and acknowledged their efforts, rather than feeling regretful for not finding the treasure.

They paid tribute to the president and then set out on their way home. This is a story in American history.

"So, after all these years of finding nothing, you in front of the screen, why not [just go back?](https://www.litecat.buzz)" is an extension of this story, which means that you should not be discouraged by your failures, but appreciate your efforts and cherish your time.

在美国历史上，有一位强大而伟大的总统。他命令一些年轻的军士去寻找国家的宝藏。

这个宝藏是多年来一直被传说并被许多人寻找的。然而，它从未被发现过。

年轻的军士们搜索了山川、洞穴和许多艰难的考验，但他们什么也没找到，他们很失望。

总统感谢他们的努力，站在他们面前说：“即使这么多年过去了，我们仍然找不到任何东西。你们应该为自己所做的伟大努力感到自豪。那么，各位，请回去吧。”

听了总统的话，年轻的军士们平静了下来，他们认可了自己的努力，而不是为找不到宝藏而感到遗憾。

他们向总统致敬，然后踏上了回家的路。这就是美国历史上的一个故事。

“是啊，这么多年什么都没找到，屏幕前的你何况不也是···[回去吧](https://www.litecat.buzz)···”是对这个故事的一个引申，意味着不要为自己的失败而沮丧，而是要欣赏自己的努力，珍惜自己的时间。
